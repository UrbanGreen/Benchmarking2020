| :--- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Order** | Order of BBLs on the disclosure data set |  |  |
|  **Property Id** | Number assigned to each benchmarking submission by Portfolio Manager. This value is unique for each record represented by the BBL field.

|  **Property Name** | Basic property information includes property name. |  |  |
|  **Parent Property Id** | The ID for the campus is referred to as the Parent Property ID. |  |  |
|  **Parent Property Name** | When you are benchmark a campus (or, collection of buildings) you can track information for the entire campus, as well as for individual buildings on the campus. If you choose to track at both of these levels, then you have "parent-child" relationship. The "parent" is the entire campus or complex. That is, the parent is the multi-building property for which you have also chosen to benchmark individual buildings separately. |  |  |
|  **City Building** | A building that is more than 10,000 gross square feet, as it appears in the records of the department of finance, that is owned by the city or for which the city regularly directly pays all [or part] of the annual energy bills, provided that two or more buildings on the same tax lot shall be deemed to be one building. |  |  |
|  **BBL - 10 digits** | 10-digit property borough, block and lot identifier, originally entered into the "Standard IDs" field in Portfolio Manager and then verified and corrected, as necessary, by the Department of Finance (DOF).
